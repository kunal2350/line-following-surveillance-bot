# line-following-surveillance-bot
A line following robot is a self-operating robot. It detects and follows a line drawn on the floor. The line may be indicated by a white line on black surface or a black line on a white surface. The line is sensed by the IR sensor. It then sends a signal to the Arduino UNO, which determines the path to be followed. It drives the motor and moves the robot along the line. Turns can be made appropriately to follow the line. This line follower robot can be installed with a camera, to be used as a surveillance bot. The camera takes pictures when an object comes within the range of the ultrasonic sensor.
